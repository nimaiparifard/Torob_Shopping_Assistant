## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

### Base Classes

#### SpecificProductAgent
Base class for agents that handle specific product queries.

**Key Methods:**
- `_extract_product_name(query)`: Extracts product name from user query
- `_extract_most_important_part(product_name)`: Identifies important parts of product name
- `search_product(product_name)`: Searches for products using multiple strategies
- `_get_product_details(random_key)`: Retrieves detailed product information

**Search Strategy:**
1. Exact name matching
2. Important part matching
3. Semantic search using FAISS
4. Fuzzy matching with similarity scoring

#### FeatureProductAgent
Extends SpecificProductAgent for handling product feature queries.

**Key Methods:**
- `_extract_product_name_and_features(query)`: Extracts both product name and desired features
- `_search_features(product_name, features)`: Searches for specific product features
- `_find_features_with_llm(product_features, query)`: Uses LLM to identify relevant features

## üéØ Specialized Agents

### 1. General Agent (`general_agent.py`)

Handles general-purpose queries and random key extraction.

**Capabilities:**
- General question answering
- Random key extraction from natural language
- Base and member random key identification
- Contextual response generation

**System Prompt Features:**
- Few-shot learning examples
- Structured output parsing
- Persian language support
- Random key pattern recognition

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = GeneralAgent()
response = await agent.process_query("What is the best laptop for gaming?")
```

### 2. Exploration Agent (`exploration_agent.py`)

Manages product exploration sessions with filtering capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Chat history management
- Multi-criteria filtering (price, brand, category, city, warranty)
- Product discovery with refinement
- Session-based exploration tracking

**Filtering Criteria:**
- Product name and description
- Brand and category
- Price range (min/max)
- City availability
- Warranty status
- Shop rating/score

**Database Integration:**
- `exploration` table for session tracking
- Complex SQL queries with JOINs
- Pagination and result limiting
- Filter persistence across sessions

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = ExplorationAgent()
response = await agent.process_query(
    "I'm looking for a laptop under $1000 with good reviews",
    chat_id="user_123"
)
```

### 3. Shop Agent (`shop_agent.py`)

Handles shop-related queries including pricing and availability.

**Query Types:**
- Mean price calculation
- Min/max price queries
- Shop count queries
- Shop listing with filters

**Database Queries:**
- Price aggregation across shops
- Shop availability by city
- Warranty-based filtering
- Rating-based shop selection

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = ShopAgent()
response = await agent.process_query(
    "What's the average price of iPhone 15 in Tehran?"
)
```

### 4. Comparison Agent (`comparison_agent.py`)

Performs multi-dimensional product comparisons.

**Comparison Types:**
- **Feature-level**: Technical specifications comparison
- **Shop-level**: Availability and pricing comparison
- **Warranty-level**: Warranty coverage comparison
- **City-level**: Geographic availability comparison
- **General**: High-level product comparison

**Advanced Features:**
- Semantic feature mapping using FAISS
- LLM-powered comparison analysis
- Winner determination logic
- Detailed comparison reports

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = ComparisonAgent()
response = await agent.process_query(
    "Compare iPhone 15 vs Samsung Galaxy S24"
)
```

### 5. Image Agent (`image_agent.py`)

Identifies main objects in images using Vision AI.

**Capabilities:**
- Image URL downloading
- Base64 image processing
- Main object identification
- Persian language responses

**Image Processing:**
- URL validation and downloading
- Base64 encoding/decoding
- Image format validation
- Size optimization

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = ImageAgent()
response = await agent.process_query(
    "What's the main object in this image?",
    image_data="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
)
```

### 6. Product Image Agent (`product_image_agent.py`)

Combines image analysis with product database lookup.

**Multi-step Process:**
1. Extract category from image
2. Extract brand from image
3. Extract phrased product name
4. Combine information for final product identification
5. Search database for matching products

**Vision AI Integration:**
- Category extraction with semantic mapping
- Brand identification with database lookup
- Product name generation
- Final decision making with LLM

**Usage Example:**
```python
agent = ProductImageAgent()
response = await agent.process_query(
    "What product is this?",
    image_data="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
)
```
